            <p id="intro">François Truffaut’s 1959 film <i>The 400 Blows</i>, tells the story of Antoine Doinel, a teenager living in Paris. In this scene, Antoine is running late for school, but as soon as he steps out the door, his friend René calls out to him. Since he is late as well, they share the concern that their teacher won’t even let them in. René then asks Antoine if he has money on him, and convinces him to skip school all together and go explore the city instead.</p>

            <p>The scene is composed mainly of long shots of Antoine and René walking around the city and a medium shot when the boys first meet outside Antoine’s house. The camera has an objective point of view since it is following their movement. The role the camera plays in this sequence is very interesting. The first 29 seconds, the camera moves to Antoine’s pace. For example, when he comes out of the house, the camera pans at the same speed that Antoine is running. Once René calls out to him, the camera stops and actually pans back a little, as Antoine stops to look back at his friend. It then moves slowly as Antoine walks next to René, before coming to a stop as the boys walk off and then it cuts to another scene.</p>

            <p>For the rest of the sequence, the camera has moved away from the boys significantly. It seems that it has a fixed position and it only pans to follow Antoine and René and keep them in frame. However, the camera doesn’t go everywhere with them. For example, there is a shot of them going into some place, but as soon as they’re gone, all the camera does is tilt up to reveal their location; a movie theater. The movement of the camera is much slower The role the camera now plays is more of a spy, secretly following the boys around in their day of rebellion. As mentioned before, in the first 29 seconds, the camera is very much accompanying Antoine to school, but that is interrupted when his friend suggests they skip. For the remainder of the sequence, the camera is almost like a bystander, looking at the boys from a distance, quietly following them. </p>

            <p id="paragraph3">There are a total of five cuts in the sequence; the first only happens once the boys have decided to not go to school and their adventure in the city begins. The cuts get more abrupt in this part of the sequence. There is even a whip pan to the left to show the boys going into the movie theater. This suggests that the camera is having a hard time keeping up with them, was trying to get a closer view, and also gives the illusion that the day is going by. Right after this it cuts to the camera being on the opposite side of the road, as it films Antoine and René crossing the street, stopping cars in the middle of the road to get through.</p>

            <p>This sequence has both diegetic and non-diegetic sound. The dialogue between Antoine and René, the moving cars, and the sounds of the city in general compromise the diegetic sounds. Whereas the non-diegetic sound is in the score. There are two musical tracks in this sequence; In the first 29 seconds of the sequence, and then it changes to the second one for the rest of it. At the beginning, it is fast paced since Antoine is about to start running off to school given his tardiness, it also gives off an innocent feeling given that he was really going to try to get to school. It then changes to an even faster-paced, more playful and almost mischievous sound. Antoine and René are really enjoying their day off from school, but they know that they could get in trouble if someone sees them, and that is what this soundtrack is conveying. What both tracks have in common is that they are exciting. It is something that the film in general does so well; it portrays the little joys of being a teenager, but at the same time, showing how hard and melancholic it can be, through its music.</p>

            <p>It was evident from this analysis that this sequence from The 400 Blows could be divided into two parts; one lasting from 20:00-20:29, and the other from 20:30-21:27. In the first section, the camera acts as Antoine’s companion on his way to school, whereas in the second section, it is a quiet onlooker as Antoine and René explore the city.</p>

            <p>What makes this film so special is that it was one of the most influential during the French New Wave. These kinds of films stood out from what had been made around the world up to that time because it presented honest forms of realism; creators “used film as an expression of [their own] artistic vision” and broke the stereotypes of classical Hollywood movies by showing a more honest and human story. This is exactly what Truffaut does in his first film given that is semi-autobiographical.</p>

            <p>Truffaut is telling his own story, and this entices the audience to have a deeper, more emotional and more empathetic connection to the character of Antoine. When Antoine is wrongfully caught with another classmate’s pinup by the teacher, the viewers feel for Antoine, as the reputation of “hell-raiser” is basically imposed on him. Not only does the acting make the audience react this way, but the editing and camera movements also aid the viewer to connect with Antoine, as if they were accompanying him along this journey. For example, the editing is discontinuous, meaning that the cuts are sometimes jarring and seem out of place. This is to give the sense that time is passing by, and also that the viewer is following behind Antoine. In addition, there are shots that are handheld, which gives the film an energetic and loose feeling. All this also makes the whole story feel more real, therefore deepening the connection between filmmaker, Antoine, and the audience. The handheld tracking of the camera can be seen right after Antoine has stolen a bottle of milk and continues to wander around Paris (40:40-41:26). The camera moves in a not completely steady way to follow Antoine’s walking. This sort of camerawork makes the viewer feel as if they are walking with him, even from a distance.</p>
